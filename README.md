## Installation Guide

This guide is for building the node from source. If you would like to just download the compiled program, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain/releases) page, which should include a pre-built DUSK node, and a pre-built wallet executable.

NOTE: This guide assumes you are building and running from a UNIX-like operating system. The node is not tested on Windows.

### Requirements

[Go](https://golang.org/) 1.17 or newer.

### Installation

First, download the codebase and it's dependencies into your $GOPATH by running:

```bash
go get github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain
```

Then, navigate to the testnet folder, like so:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dusk-network/dusk-blockchain
```

To build the binary, simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Finally, to start your node, type:

```bash
./bin/dusk --config=dusk.toml
```

## Wallet

The wallet is hosted in a separate folder, [found here](./cmd/wallet). 

### Building the wallet

The wallet is automatically built when running `make build`. You can then execute it by typing:

```bash
./bin/wallet
```


### Running the wallet

Alternatively, to build and run the wallet in a single command, simply type:

```bash
make wallet
```

### How to use the wallet

The wallet will show you a menu with available options, that you can navigate with the arrow keys and the enter key.

Note that the wallet is a seperate process from the node, and thus closing the wallet does not stop the node from running.
