### Architecture

The candidate generator component is triggered by the score generator, through the `ScoreEvent` message. After receiving this message, the candidate generator will start constructing a candidate block. First off, it requests all verified transactions from the mempool. It prepends a coinbase transaction to this set, which rewards him with the agreed-upon reward amount. It then constructs the block header, and calculates the block merkle root, and the hash. Finally, it wraps the `ScoreEvent` into a `Score` message, and the newly created block into a `Candidate` message, before propagating both of these messages to the rest of the network.
