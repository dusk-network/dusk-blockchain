# Block Generator

This package implements a full block generator component, to be used by participants of the blind-bid protocol in the SBA\* consensus. It is internally made up of two distinct components, a [score generator](./score/README.md), and a [candidate generator](./candidate/README.md).

## Abstract

`Block Generator` is the first of the two full-node types eligible to participate in the consensus \(the other being the `Provisioner`\). To become a `Block Generator`, a full-node has to submit a `Bid Transaction`. The `Block Generator` is eligible to participate in one phase - the _block generation_ where the `Block Generators` participates in a non-interactive lottery to be able to forge a candidate block.

## Blind Bid Algorithm

The block generation makes use of `bulletproof`-based _zero-knowledge cryptography_ in order to prove the correct computation of a _score_ associated with a `block candidate` which gets validated and selected by Provisioners during the _score selection_ phase carried out by the `selection` package.

### Procedure

The `Blind Bid` algorithm is outlined in the following steps

1. A universal counter `N` is maintained for all bidding transactions in the lifetime.
2. Seed `S` is computed and broadcasted.
3. Bidder selects secret `K`.
4. Bidder sends a bidding transaction with data `M = H(K)`.
5. For every bidding transaction with d coins and data M an entry `X = H(d,M,N)` is added to `T`. Then `N` is increased.
6. Potential bidder computes `Y =H(S,X)`, score `Q=F(d,Y)`, and identifier `Z =H(S,M)`.
7. Bidder selects a bid root `RT` and broadcasts proof `π = Π(Z, RT, Q, S; K, d, N)`.
