# Chain

## Responsibility

* Given a block, verify whether the block is valid according to the consensus rules
* Given a transaction, verify whether a transaction is valid

## API

* AcceptBlock\(block\) Verifies and saves a block
* VerifyBlock\(block\) - Verifies a block is valid, including the transactions
* VerifyTX\(tx\) - Verifies a tx is valid. For the mempool

## Usage

* AcceptBlock will be used by all nodes, when they recieve a new proposed block, that should be added to the chain
* VerifyBlock will be used by consensus nodes, to verify that a block is valid without saving it.
* VerifyTX will be used by the mempool to Verify a TX is valid and can be added to the mempool.

### Consensus Rules

* No double spending, check with utxo database
* time difference between the last block should not be more than 60 minutes
* Current blockheader, should reference the previous block header
* Seed, public key, etc in block should be X Bytes
* Zkproof should be valid in block
